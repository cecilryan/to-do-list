# to-do-list

#Using to-do list allows the user to create their own list of activities for the day, or edit a pre-existing one. The user can use commands to view their current list, add items, rearrange them, mark as completed, or delete items off of the list, keeping a relatively organized day.
#If the user chooses to add a task, they are prompted to input the task and where in the list they would like to add it.
#If the user chooses to remove a task, they are prompted to input the task # they would like to remove.
#Asking to view the list will return a copy of all tasks in the list.
#If the user finishes a task, they can input which task they have finished and the code will mark it as completed.
